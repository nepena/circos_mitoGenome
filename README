This is documentation to creating mitochondrial genome coverage map utilizng Circo L"http://circos.ca/"

Using previous used written code to generate plot 
L"https://github.com/photocyte/plot_mitochondrial_genome_with_CIRCOS/blob/master/README.md"


To run program: 

bash ./used_commands.txt


Keep in mind that PATHS to FASTA genome and BEDFILE must be correct to properly run 
Also add circos and seqkit to your PATH to run. The following are where I placed each program 
and exported the to my PATHS. 
    export PATH=~/software/circos/current/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATh
